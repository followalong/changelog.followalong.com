For years, it's been a dream to have a marketplace of ideas where you can customize your Follow Along experience. We're proud to announce the "Marketplace" &mdash; it's *finally* here!

We've rolled out a new page called "Marketplace" where you can see and install our pre-built Add-ons. The high-level concept has been around since version 1.0, but this new shape brings fresh opportunities to the future of Follow Along. As of right now, we have 2 add-ons â€“ a generic and configurable CORS Anywhere proxy, as well as our officially supported CORS proxy.

When you install an add-on, you'll be able to customize it's behaviour. For example, our CORS Anywhere proxy can be pointed to any URL of your choice.

We're really excited with the prospects of add-ons; the future is bright. Within days, we'll be releasing our third add-on &mdash; it's a paradigm-shifting game-changer.

Oh... one more thing... in case you were wondering... **YES**! In the future, we'll be releasing an SDK for developers to submit their own add-ons to the marketplace (and get paid!).
