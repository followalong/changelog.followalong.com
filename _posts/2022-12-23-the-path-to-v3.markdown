title: The Path to V3 in 2023
tags: changelog
---

Over the last few years, Follow Along has been slowly improving, but its time start anew on a solid foundation. This is rarely a good idea, but the time is come. Building on the uncoverings of the past and re-thinking the future, we're moving forward to V3. 

The impetus of change was the migrate to an event-sourcing model, which I'll explain in a later update. At its core, event-sourcing will allow us to add more features with confidence.

Up until now, Follow Along has been fairly "anti-social" â€“ no interactions with the authors or others, just *following along*. The path forward will come in waves, culminating in bringing the full "social" experience to Follow Along. In addition, we have a few monetization tricks up our sleeve.

Cheers and on to 2023!
